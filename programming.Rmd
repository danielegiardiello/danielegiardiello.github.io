### Github repositories

- [`Prediction_performance_survival`](https://github.com/danielegiardiello/Prediction_performance_survival) (author). R and SAS code repository for the manuscript 'Assessing performance and clinical usefulness in prediction models with survival outcomes: practical guidance for Cox proportional hazards models'(submitted). Preprint available [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.17.22272411v1);  

- [`ValidationCompRisks`](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks) (author of .Rmd files/maintainer), R Code repository for the manuscript ['Validation of prediction models in presence of competing risks: a guide through modern methods'](https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069249.abstract).  
- [`ValLogRegMod`](https://github.com/danielegiardiello/ValLogRegMod) (author of .Rmd files/maintainer), R Code repository for the manuscript ['Assessing the performance of prediction models: a framework for some traditional and novel measures'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010215/). The repository tries to provide guidance about how to develop and validate a risk prediction model for binary outcomes using logistic regression including more recent updates about performance assessment.  

### CRAN packages
- [`raters`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raters/index.html) (creator), a package of functions to assess the reliability of agreement among multiple observers. A Modification of Fleiss' Kappa in Case of Nominal and Ordinal Variables is proposed.
