### About me
I am currently a Biostatistician at the [EURAC research](https://www.eurac.edu/en) in the [Institute of Biomedicine](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-biomedicine) in Bolzano (Italy).
I am an applied biostatistician with strong interests in biostatistical methods about risk prediction and clinical epidemiology.  

### Research interests
My general research interests are statistical methods for observational studies. In particular, I am interested in risk prediction modelling and causal inference. These interests are motivated by applications in medicine, especially in oncology. 

#### PhD dissertation 
My PhD dissertation _"Prediction of contralateral breast cancer - Statistical aspects and performance assessment"_ is available [here](https://books.gildeprint.nl/thesis/579953-Giardiello/). 

#### Challenges in biostatistics during the PhD trajectory
This PhD project poses multiple challenges in biostatistics. For example, it is not clear how to develop and validate a risk prediction model with survival outcomes with and without competing risks in the scenario of Individual Patient Data Meta Analysis (IPD-MA) incorporating multiple data sources.   

Clear guidance is lacking for a comprehensive assessment of the performance for survival and competing risks models.  
We propose frameworks for performance evaluation of predictions and for clinical utility of survival and competing risks models to provide guidance in the context of the [STRATOS](https://www.stratos-initiative.org/) international initiative with the accompanying R and SAS code. More details are provided in the programming page [section](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/programming.html). 

The collaboration between the Department of Molecular Pathology of the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl/) and the Department of Biomedical Data Sciences at [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/org/bds/) was essential for this project.
