### About me
I am an applied biostatistician with strong interests in biostatistical methods about risk prediction, clinical epidemiology and causal inference.  

This website contains my (current) general and specific research interests and a collection of my work, such as selected [publications](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/research.html) and my current contributions to methodological developments in biostatistics, especially as a [programmer](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/programming.html).   

More details can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/danielegiardiello), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DGiardiello_), and [Google Scholar](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/contact.html).  

My detailed CV is available [here](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/files/CV_DGiardiello_202209.pdf).

#### General research interests
My general research interests are statistical methods for observational studies. In particular, I am interested in risk prediction modelling and causal inference. These interests are motivated by applications in medicine, especially in oncology. 

#### Specific (research) interests

+ Analysis of Individual Patient Data (Meta) Analysis. A good reference [here](https://www.ipdma.co.uk/); 
+ Survival analysis;  
+ Risk prediction modelling including dynamic prediction;  
+ Causal inference and causal risk prediction modelling;  
+ Machine learning algorithms;  
+ R/Python programming;
