### About me
I am a statistician with strong interests in applied and methodological statistical aspects especially about risk prediction, epidemiology and causal inference.  

This website contains my (current) general and specific research interests and a collection of my work such as selected [publications](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/research.html) and my contributions to methodological developments in medical statistics, especially as a [programmer](https://danielegiardiello.github.io/programming.html).   

More details can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/danielegiardiello) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6Xro0z8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).  


#### General research interests
My general research interests are statistical methods for observational studies. In particular, I am interested in applied and methodological aspects especially about risk prediction modelling and causal inference. These interests are motivated by applications in biomedical sciences.
