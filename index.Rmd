### About me
I am currently a Biostatistician at the [EURAC research](https://www.eurac.edu/en) in the [Institute of Biomedicine](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-biomedicine) in Bolzano (Italy).


### Research interests
My general research interests are statistical methods for observational studies. In particular, I am interested in risk prediction modelling and causal inference. These interests are motivated by applications in medicine, especially in oncology.

#### PhD trajectory

The goal of my PhD trajectory is to develop, validate, and evaluate the clinical utility of a contralateral breast cancer risk prediction model including more than 200,000 women diagnosed with first primary breast cancer coming from multiple studies in Europe (in particular from the Netherlands), United States, and Australia.  

Population- and hospital-based studies were included in this project as [the Netherlands Cancer Registry](https://iknl.nl/en/ncr), Amsterdam Breast Cancer Study, Breast Cancer Outcome Study of Mutation carriers (BOSOM), Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) study, and [Hereditary Breast and Ovarian cancer study](https://www.hebon.nl/). We addionally included data from the [Breast Cancer Association Consortium](https://bcac.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/).

This project poses multiple challenges in biostatistics. For example, it is not clear how to develop and validate a risk prediction model with survival outcomes with and without competing risks in the scenario of Individual Patient Data Meta Analysis (IPD-MA) incorporating multiple data sources.   

Briefly, clear guidance is lacking for a comprehensive assessment of the performance for survival and competing risks models.  
We propose frameworks for performance evaluation of predictions and for clinical utility of survival and competing risks models to provide guidance in the context of the [STRATOS](https://www.stratos-initiative.org/) international initiative with the accompanying R and SAS code.

The collaboration between the Department of Molecular Pathology of the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl/) and the Department of Biomedical Data Sciences at [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/org/bds/) was essential for this project.
