I am a Biostatistician at the [EURAC research](https://www.eurac.edu/en) at the [Institute of Biomedicine](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-biomedicine).
My research interests are statistical methods for observational studies. In particular, I am interested in risk prediction modelling and causal inference.

I earned my MSc in biostatistics in 2012 from  [University of Milan-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/) (Italy).

I am currently finalizing a PhD at the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl/) with the collaboration of the [Department of Biomedical Data Sciences at Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/org/bds/) (the Netherlands).
